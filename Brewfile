# it certainly handles dependencies that other dotfiles need, or it should always
brew "fish"             # shell
brew "zoxide"           # z autojump
brew "mcfly"            # replaces ctrl-r for shell history
brew "neovim"           # text editor
brew "delta"            # better git diff viewer
brew "eza"              # I alias `ls` to this
brew "curl"             # http client

brew "usage"            # mise dependency for autocomplete
brew "mise"             # language manager, replacing asdf

brew "jq"               # json parser
brew "htop"             # system stats, btop is also nice

tap "homebrew/services" # I prefer background processes

# brew list --cask would show casks only
# and then you could install them here but I'm not doing that
# this isn't configuration management syncing
